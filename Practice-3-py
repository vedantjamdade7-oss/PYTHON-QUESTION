# Q-1. Leap year: Write a simple program to determine if a given year is a leap year using user input

# Note:
# Leap year occurs once every four years.
# 4 divisible & 100 not divisible
# 400 divisible

# user input
year = int(input("Enter a year :")) 

# checking leap year
if  (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100  != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not leap year")
